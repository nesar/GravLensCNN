Implementing 4 deep learning schemes for Gravitational lensing analysis.

* ConvNet Classification: Aimed at automated identification of lensing images in astronomical surveys.
* ConvNet Regression: For a non-linear regression on strong lensing images from the simulations. 
* Generative Adversarial Networks (under development): Aimed at generating new images from convolutional networks trained from simulated images.
